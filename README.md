# Daily-Weather

## Introduction
Daily Weather is a weather app written in Java and styled using JavaFX/CSS. Weather data was retrieved using the RESTful 
[WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) 

## Goals
The goal of RainyDay was to create a great-looking and functional weather application similar to the Samsung weather widget that other Android phones should have.
It is also a great way to utilize my experience with Java as there aren't that many weather applications using Java. For this project, I specifically used JavaFX (GUI), 
SceneBuilder, Maven, CSS, and RESTFUl APIs,
